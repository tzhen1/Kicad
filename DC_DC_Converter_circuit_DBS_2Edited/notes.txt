Benefits of design
-Save half the cost by implementing a trim circuit for 12V-13V
-Snappable board design for ease of desoldering
-Using cheap and high voltage pheonix connectors (Â£1.90 ea) (link: https://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/pcb-terminal-blocks/8045095/)

Fixes to make:
- hole alignment for mounting and -VOUT & +VOUT(use the tinkercad link for verification)
- Change the 12 header to 10 pin header (done)\
- no inventor to get dimensions fitting
